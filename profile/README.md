## About Us

We are Blind Elephant Media, a small indie game development team. We see the value in open source and want to contribute to the community. Our GitHub is a collection of our explorations and experiments in Unity game development. These projects are not complete tools, but rather starting points or sources of inspiration.

## Our Projects

Our projects are at various stages of development. They serve as a testament to what can be achieved with creativity and collaboration. Each project comes with a README to provide some insight into our process and how you might use these ideas in your own Unity projects.

## Join Our Journey

We're currently working on an RTS game. If you're interested in seeing these repositories in action and learning more about our game development process, consider joining our Discord server.

## Connect With Us

We welcome questions, feedback, and friendly conversations. Feel free to open an issue in one of our repositories or join our Discord server.
